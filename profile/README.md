## Welcome to the Geocaml Organisation!

Geocaml is an organisation for OCaml libraries to do geospatial things. Some libraries that are already released include:

 - [ocaml-geojson](https://github.com/geocaml/ocaml-geojson) for reading and writing GeoJSON. There is also a non-blocking, streaming parser for GeoJSON too.
 - [ISO3166](https://github.com/geocaml/ISO3166) for all things country codes.

Some projects in the pipeline include [A TIFF library](https://github.com/geocaml/ocaml-tiff), a [carbon intensity library](https://github.com/geocaml/carbon-intensity) and [a TopoJSON library](https://github.com/geocaml/ocaml-topojson).

We follow the OCaml community's code of conduct, see [our copy in this repository](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This applies to all repositories under the Geocaml organisation (even if they don't have a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in the source code yet).
